# MMCC2041-Website
Website created as part of a major work for MMCC2041 - Interactive Web Design.

**Notes:**
This project uses HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/Jquery and additional tools such as scss.
The website utilises responsive design and uses css properties such as gridbox, animations etc.
HTML video/images were used to display GIFS, images and videos.
JavaScript/Jquery was used to make the navigation dissapear whilst scrolling down and reappear when scrolling up. Further, the gridbox was designed to make the subtitles appear/disappear as the user hovers over them.

**Challenges:** Overall i didn't find this project very challenging in terms of implementing any of the features i've listed here. Although i did run into some problems when my Jquery gave off errors. After 45m of reasearch i figured out that the error was because of the order of execution within my Jquery. When the site first loaded the first thing initialising was my Jquery and as a result of that my variables were returning 'null' as opposed to the location of the page. I fixed this by simply moving the Jquery section of the code to the bottom of the screen.

Other than the error, this project served more as a refinement for the skills i already had. I attempted to use more semantic HTML through things such as article tags, figure/fig-caption etc. Further, this project served as a great introduction for me into JavaScript/JQuery as well as additional practice around SCSS such as the creation of variables for primary colours used throughout the site and nesting css.

**What's Next:** The next step for me is to create a website which utilises an API. I have already managed to make a demo in my spare time connecting to NASA's APOD API and display its content into html. But, i'm ready to go further and utilise a more sophisticated API.

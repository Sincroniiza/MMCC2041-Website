          unprecedented 2019-20 bushfires at least 30% more likely. seen
          anything like it. <br /><br />
          Globally, climate change is providing the perfect conditions for
          wildfires to flourish and consume, consuming larger amounts of land
          and having massive impacts on humans, wildlife, and the economy.

          Fires in the Amazon have reached unusual severity and new highs.
          Brazils Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, had reached their
          highest level since records began in 1998. In addition, the US has
          entered a record-breaking fire season, projecting more land to be
          burned by fire than any year previously recorded.
          <br /><br />
          The US fires in 2020 have killed 30 people. Australian fires have
          killed 9. Billions of dollars in damages and recovery costs are being
          allocated to combat the rising threat of wildfires, and it’s only set
          to get worse.

        <p>
          In California, bushfires have become increasingly ferocious, pushing
          habitats to the brink and forcing families to abandon their
          livelihoods and homes. In 2020 alone, more than 4% of the state’s land
          had burnt. This accounts to
          <mark class="red">1,779,730 hectares of land</mark> with roughly 9,917
          separate fires recorded, making 2020 the largest wildfire season
          recorded in California’s modern history. <br /><br />
          There is no indication that these extreme wildfires will start to
          diminish in their severity or frequency, but in fact, quite the
          opposite. With the escalation of global warming it’s expected that
          such extreme natural disasters will become ever more popular and
          continue to destroy habitats and livelihoods.
          <br /><br />
          Extreme wildfires such as the one seen in California in 2020 also
          means that the region will continuously see abnormal levels of smoke
          lingering for months. This has a disastrous impact on the most
          vulnerable people such as those with asthma, and further, the general
          population, where air quality dramatically spikes up to 10x that of
          which is considered “healthy air quality” according to the Air Quality
          Index (AQI). In 2020 California experienced “Hazardous” air quality
          for weeks on end. In this category its recommended to “avoid all
          physical activity outdoors” with an extra warning for “sensitive
          groups”.
          <br /><br />
          The impacts of California’s wildfires have been disastrous in many
          aspects of its society. From the loss of habitats, economic impacts
          and general health complications that are directly correlated with
          wildfires, California is centre stage experiencing the impacts of a
          warming climate.

          2019 was host to some of the most disastrous bushfires Australia has
          ever seen. The environmental, economic, and personal damages
          experienced during this period can be hard to comprehend. The
          2019-2020 Australian bushfire season consumed approximately
          <mark class="red">18,636,079 hectares of land.</mark> That’s over 10x
          the land burned during 2020 in California and comparable to the size
          of the United Kingdom. The fires were felt right across the country,
          hundreds of homes were lost, billions of animals killed, and a toxic
          air quality was felt throughout regional areas and big cities. This
          hazardous smoke pollution was further felt by Australia’s neighbouring
          country New Zealand. <br /><br />
          <mark class="red">Nearly 3 billion</mark> animals consisting of
          mammals, reptiles, birds, and frogs were killed by Australia’s
          devastating 2019-2020 bushfires. This figure is broken down into 143
          million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds and 51
          million frogs. <br /><br />
          Guardian Australia has spoken to some of the millions of people
          touched by Australia's summer of dread. Here, we take you on a journey
          through some of the country's worst-affected areas.
          <br /><br />
          Australia has been getting consistently hotter, recording new
          temperature records for the past 4 decades. The country broke its
          all-time high temperature record twice in December. An average maximum
          temperature of <mark class="red">40.9C</mark> was recorded on 17
          December, broken a day later by <mark class="red">41.9C</mark>. This
          follows 4 other all time high records dating back from 1980.

        <p>
          In 2020, more than 2,500 major fires burned across the Brazilian
          Amazon, burning over
          <mark class="red">906,000 hectares of land</mark>. The uniqueness of
          these fires stem from the location in which they burn. Wildfires are
          in fact quite rare in tropical rainforests due the high humidity and
          wet conditions. The flora is commonly too wet for lightning to spark a
          fire or for accidental fires to gain much ground. But nevertheless, we
          have seen the largest rainforest in the world burn vigorously.
          <br /><br />
          The Amazon is home to the most biodiverse species on Earth. The fires
          witnessed throughout 2020 have radically damaged this ecosystem by
          polluting rivers and lands, diminishing food sources, degrading the
          soil, and causing large quantities of land to dry out. The economic
          fallout is estimated to cost Brazil anywhere from
          <mark class="red">$957 billion </mark> to
          <mark class="red">$3.5 trillion </mark> US dollars over a 30-year
          period. <br /><br />
          Some scientists fear that a combination of fires, increasing drought
          due to climate change, and deforestation could lead to a tipping point
          for the Amazon which harbours roughly 10% of the world’s biodiversity.
          <br /><br />
          Since forest fires are a newer phenomenon in the Amazon, the time in
          which the rainforest recovers after such devastating events is not
          known or if a recovery occurs in the first place. The Amazons dry
          seasons are getting longer, and mega-droughts are becoming more
          common, driven by climate change and deforestation.

          The damages inflicted by these catastrophic bushfires across the world
          are immense. We know that mass amounts of ecosystems are burnt along
          with billions of animals and habitats. But this extends much further.
          In the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires the economic costs have been
          some of the highest the country has ever seen in any natural disaster
          before it.
          <br /><br />An unprecedented $100 billion dollars have been set aside
          as a concequence of the black summer bushfires, including
          <mark class="red">2,448 homes destroyed</mark> and
          <mark class="red">26 lives lost </mark>according to the Australian
          Institute for Disaster Resilience. The black summer also accounted for
          approximately <mark class="red">61,000 koala deaths</mark>, a species
          listed as critically endangered.

          During the 2019 Australian bushfires a staggering number of habitats
          and animals were burnt down and or killed. The devastating bushfires
          have consumed nearly
          <mark class="red">3 billion animals</mark> according to leading
          scientists who have revealed the scale of the impact on native
          wildlife throughout the country. <br /><br />
          According to The Guardian an estimated 143 million mammals, 180
          million birds, 51 million frogs and an extraordinary 2.5 billion
          reptiles were severely affected by the fires that occurred in
          Australia during the end of 2019.
          <br /><br />
          It’s clear that the world will continue to see unprecedented natural
          events such as the extremely damaging wildfires we’ve witnessed across
          the world. As a consequence of global warming the world may further
          see the rapid deterioration of habitats, species and livelihoods.
